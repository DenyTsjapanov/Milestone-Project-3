# Milestone Project 3 ("WANTiT!") deployed at: https://i-wanna-app.herokuapp.com/

"WANTiT!" is a basic wishlist app. It provides the function (under the CRUD method) to create, view, edit and/or delete items by user's input. A user can create an account, after which he can create items to be stored inside of the wishlist. These items are presented in a Bootstrap card form, providing basic information, such as tyhe item's name, optional description, price and a button that targets a link to an online webshop offering said item/product. Whilst logged in, the user can the view his/her profile to view all items, and subsequently edit or completely remove items from the account. When not logged it, all users have access to viewing all stored and uploaded items as part of the "Get ideas for a gift" understanding.
 
## UX
 
The most important part of this app is its simplicity. Upon loading of the app, the user is greeted with a bulk of items in card forms. These items can only be viewed, regardless of whether the user is logged in or not. This prevents any users that are not logged in to make any modifications, and user that are logged in to accidentally edit or delete entries.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
